# PollingSystemDjango
Prediction and Analysis in Polling System
This is the Project based on Python and Django. This provides users to create an account on the portal and conduct the live polling. 
Every user who wants to cast a vote or who want to coduct a survey can easily login into the portal using email-id and password and create a poll or simply cast a vote. 
To make it more secure, included an SMTP protocol which sends the authentication mail on the registered email-id for the first time login users.
